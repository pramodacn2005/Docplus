# Assets Folder

This folder should contain the following image files for your app:

## Required Files:

1. **icon.png** - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
   - Used as the main app icon on iOS and Android
   - Should be a square image

2. **splash.png** - Splash screen image (optional)
   - Shown when the app is launching
   - Recommended size: 1242x2436px for iOS, 1284x2778px for Android

3. **adaptive-icon.png** - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
   - Used for Android adaptive icons
   - Should be a square image with transparent background

4. **favicon.png** - Web favicon (48x48px or 96x96px)
   - Used when running the app on web

## Quick Setup:

You can generate these icons using:
- Online tools like https://www.appicon.co/
- Expo's icon generator
- Or create them manually using design tools

## For Now:

The app.json has been configured to work without these files. You can add them later when you have your app icons ready.
